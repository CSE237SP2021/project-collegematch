CollegeMatch is a Java application that helps students find the college of their dreams and helps college admin officers market their college to students!

What user stories were completed this iteration?
This iteration, we focused on the student side. Students can now register and login to the app, get college matches, and get information about certain colleges. 

What user stories do you intend to complete next iteration?
In the next iteration, we plan to work on the college admin officer side. Admin officers will be able to register and login to the app, edit college descriptions, and add new colleges to our "database."

Is there anything that you implemented but doesn't currently work?
   Currently, there is an option to display saved colleges, but we have not added any functionality to add to saved colleges, so this list is always empty at this time. In the future, we will allow the user to edit their saved college list as a separate option on the menu. 
   Additionally, simplifications were made. For example, our current college "database" consists of 4 saved colleges in the app itself. In the future, we will create a csv file that can be read and written to for our college database. 

What commands are needed to compile and run your code from the command line (or better yet, provide a script that people can use to run your program!)
The user can run the CollegeMatch.sh script in our repository to compile and run our code from the command line.
