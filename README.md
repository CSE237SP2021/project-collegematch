# CollegeMatch

CollegeMatch is a Java application that helps students find the college of their dreams and helps college admin officers market their college to students!

This iteration, we focused on the student side. Students can now register and login to the app, get college matches, and get information about certain colleges.

In the next iteration, we plan to work on the college admin officer side. Admin officers will be able to register and login to the app, edit college descriptions, and add new colleges to our "database."

Currently, there is an option to display saved colleges, but we have not added any functionality to add to saved colleges, so this list is always empty at this time. In the future, we will allow the user to edit their saved college list as a separate option on the menu. Additionally, simplifications were made. For example, our current college "database" consists of 4 saved colleges in the app itself. In the future, we will create a csv file that can be read and written to for our college database.

The 4 colleges are Dartmouth College, Havard College, Washington University, and Iowa State University.

The user can run the runCollegeMatch.sh script in our repository to compile and run our code from the command line. Please cd into the project-collegematch folder on your computer before running the script.
